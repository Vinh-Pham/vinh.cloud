Destructuring is a syntax feature that allows you to extract multiple pieces of data from an array or object and assign them to their own variable in a single line. This can make your code more readable and concise.

## Array Destructuring
Array destructuring works for all iterable values.

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
const [first, second, third, fourth, fifth] = numbers
const [a, b, c] = letters

console.log(first, second, third, fourth, fifth) // Outputs: 1 2 3 4 5
console.log(a, b, c) // Outputs: a b c
```

## Object Destructuring
```typescript
const obj = { first: 'John', last: 'Jacobson' }
const { first, last } = obj

console.log(first, last) // Outputs: John Jacobson
```

Destructuring objects allows assigning a different name.
```typescript
const obj = { first: 'John', last: 'Jacobson' }
const { first: john, last: jacobson } = obj

console.log(john, jacobson) // Outputs: John Jacobson
```

## Other Uses
So far we've seen destructuring during assignments, however, they can be used in several other places.

They can be used in parameter definitions.
```typescript
function myFunc ([x, y, z]) {
  console.log(x, y, z) // Outputs: a b c
}

myFunc(['a', 'b', 'c'])

function myOtherFunc ({ first, last }) {
  console.log(first, last) // Outputs: John Jacobson
}

myOtherFunc({ first: 'John', last: 'Jacobson' })
```

They can also be used in function returns.

```typescript
function myOtherFunc () {
  return { first: 'John', last: 'Jacobson' }
}

const { first, last } = myOtherFunc()
```

You can destructure nested objects.

```typescript
const obj = { name: { first: 'John', last: 'Jacobson' }, age: 30}
const { name: { first, last }, age } = obj

console.log(first, last, age) // Outputs: John Jacobson 30
```

You don't have to destructure every field. You may pick and choose what you need.

For objects, you can choose any field in the object you are interested in.

For arrays, you can only extract the prefix. If you need to skip a value, you may just leave a comma in place of the value.

```typescript
const { x, z } = { x: 3, y: 5, z: 10 }
const [x, , z] = [3, 5, 10]
```

For objects and arrays, you may use the rest operator to bind and store the rest of the object properties or array that wasn't destructured. The rest operator must be last in the assignment.

```typescript
const { a, c, ...rest } = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 1, x: 3, y: 5, z: 10}
console.log(a, c, rest) // Outputs: 1 1 { b: 2, x: 3, y: 5, z: 10 }

const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(a, b, rest) // Outputs: 1 2 [3, 4, 5]
```
