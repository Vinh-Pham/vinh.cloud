Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is used to track changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

## Installing Git

Git can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the latest version from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Confirm that Git has been installed by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
git --version
``` 

## Git Basics

### Configuring Git

To configure Git, use the `git config` command. It is recommended to set your name and email address.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john@example.com"
```

### Creating a Repository

To create a new repository, use the `git init` command.

```bash
git init
```

This will create a new `.git` folder in the current directory. This folder contains all the information about the repository and is hidden by default.

### Cloning a Repository

To clone an existing repository instead, use the `git clone` command.

```bash
git clone <url>
```

Now you are remotely connected to the repository. You can make changes and push them to the remote repository.

To view the remotes of the repository, use the `git remote` command.

```bash
git remote
```

This will create a new folder with the name of the repository and clone the repository into it.

### Checking the Status

To check the status of the repository, use the `git status` command.

```bash
git status
```

This will show you the current branch, files in the staging area, and untracked files.

### Adding Files

To add files to the staging area, use the `git add` command.

```bash
git add <file>
```

To add all files that has been created or modified to the staging area, use the `git add .` command. This will not include deleted files.

```bash
git add .
```

To include all files, including deleted files, use the `git add -A` command.

```bash
git add -A
```

To include only modifications and deletions, use the `git add -u` command.

```bash
git add -u
```

### Committing Changes

To commit changes to the repository, use the `git commit` command, generally you also want to include `-m` to add a commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "Commit Message"
```

### Pushing Changes

Once you have committed changes, you can push them to the remote repository.

To push changes to the remote repository, use the `git push` command.

```bash
git push
```

### Pulling Changes

Let's say that you are working on a project with other people. You will need to pull changes from the remote repository before you can push your changes.

To pull changes from the remote repository, use the `git pull` command.

```bash
git pull
```

### Branching

Branching allows you to work on different parts of the project without affecting the main branch.

To create a new branch, use the `git branch` command.

```bash
git branch <branch>
```

### Viewing Branches

To view the branches of the repository, use the `git branch` command.

```bash
git branch
```

### Git Checkout

Git checkout allows you to switch between branches.

```bash
git checkout <branch>
```

### Merging

Merging allows you to merge changes from one branch into another.

To merge a branch into the current branch, use the `git merge` command.

```bash
git merge <branch>
```

### Rebasing

Rebasing allows you to reapply commits on top of another base commit.

To rebase a branch onto the current branch, use the `git rebase` command.

```bash
git rebase <branch>
```

### Stashing

Sometimes you may want to stash changes to work on something else because you are not ready to commit your current changes.

To stash changes, use the `git stash` command.

```bash
git stash
```

### Viewing Stashes

To view the stashes of the repository, use the `git stash` command.

```bash
git stash
```

### Resetting

To reset changes for a file, use the `git reset` command.

```bash
git reset <file> 
```

### Viewing History

To view the history of the repository, use the `git log` command.

```bash
git log
```

### Ignoring Files

Soemtimes you may want to ignore certain files from being tracked by Git, such as `.env` files.

To have Git ignore certain files, edit the `.gitignore` file in the root of the repository.

## Summary

These are the basics of Git. There are many more commands and options available. You can find more information in the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs).

## Git Clients

If you prefer not to work with the command line, there are Git clients available.

I recommend [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/?via=vinh) as it is available on Windows and macOS and packs a lot of features into a simple and easy to use interface.
