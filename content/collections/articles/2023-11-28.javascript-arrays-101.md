An array in JavaScript is an object that allows storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable. Arrays in JavaScript are resizable and can contain different types of data (string, number, boolean, etc). Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element starts at index `0` and so on. The length of an array would be the final index - 1.

## Creating JavaScript Arrays

There are multiple ways to create an array in JavaScript.

The most basic syntax uses the bracket notation, `[]` which is known as an array literal. You list the values between the brackets, separating them with commas.

```typescript
const digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const names = ['John', 'Mike', 'Bob', 'Lindsay']
const people = [{ name: 'John', age: 24 }, { name: 'Mike', age: 30 }]
```

The array constructor can also be used. There are two ways to use this:

1. Passing a single number will construct an array with a fixed length without any elements (each element will be `undefined`). 
2. Passing multiple values will construct an array with those values

```typescript
const arr = new Array(3)
console.log(arr) // Outputs: [undefined, undefined, undefined]
console.log(arr.length) // Outputs: 3

const arr = new Array(1, 2, 3)
console.log(arr) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(arr.length) // Outputs: 3
```

Using `Array.from` allows you to create a new array from array-like objects or any iterable object. Manipulating the copied array does not affect the original.

```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const arr2 = Array.from(arr)

console.log(arr2) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr2.push(6)
console.log(arr) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(arr2) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

A more cleaner and better alternative is to use the spread syntax, `...myArr`. The spread syntax can be used by prefixing any array or iterable with 3 periods,  `...`,  which will unpack all the values. This allows you to build a new array from another another along with new values.

```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(...arr) // Outputs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
const arr2 = [...arr, 6, 7, 8]
const arr3 = [0, ...arr, ...arr2]

console.log(arr2) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
console.log(arr3) // Outputs: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

There are also built-in array methods that allows you to perform operations on an array and returns a new array which will be discussed later.

## Accessing & Iterating JavaScript Arrays

Array elements can be retrieved by calling the array with the index enclosed in brackets, `myArr[3]`. Remember, arrays are zero-based indexed. So `myArr[3]` would retrieve the value at the fourth position.

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

console.log(numbers[0]) // Outputs: 1
console.log(numbers[3]) // Outputs: 4
```

A common operation is to go through each array value, known as iterating over an array to perform a specific task.

You can use a for-of loop.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (const num of nums) {
	console.log(num) // Outputs: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
}
```

Arrays also have built-in methods to allow you to iterate over an array. One of the most common method is the `forEach`, which allows you to iterate over each value. The method will run the provided function over each element.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// num is the current array element
nums.forEach(function (num) {
	console.log(num) // Outputs: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
})
```

## Common JavaScript Array Methods

As mentioned previously, JavaScript arrays have many built-in methods to allow iterating or performing multitude of tasks on an array. Below we will take a look at some common build-in methods and how we can use them.



### Array.push

In JavaScript, arrays do not have a fixed sized and you can freely remove or insert new elements to an existing array. The `Array.push` method allows you to insert a new array element to the end of the array. Calling this method affects the array that it was called on.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums.push(6)
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
nums.push(7)
nums.push(8)
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Array.shift

`Array.shift` will remove the first element of an array. Using this method also affects the array it was called on. The return value of this method is the element that was removed.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
nums.shift()
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [2, 3, 4, 5]
const removedNum = nums.shift()
console.log(removedNum) // Outputs: 2
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [3, 4, 5]
```

### Array.map

The `Array.map` method performs similarily to the `Array.forEach` but it returns a new array. With this, you can return a value in the provided function to build out a new array.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const newArray = nums.map(function (num) {
  return num * 2
})

console.log(newArray) // Outputs: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Array.filter

The `Array.filter` performs similarily like `Array.map`, but depending on the truthy or falsy-ness of the return value, it will either store that value in the new array or not.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const newArray = nums.filter(function (num) {
  return >= 3 // Evaluate num and if the value is 3 or greater, return true
})

console.log(newArray) // Outputs: [3, 4, 5]
```

### Array.includes

A common operation is to check if an array has a certain value. `Array.includes` will return `true` or `false` if the value exists in the array or not.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const hasThree = nums.includes(3)
const hasTen = nums.includes(10)
console.log(hasThree) // Outputs: true
console.log(hasTen) // Outputs: false
```

### Array.every

The `Array.every` method receives a function and performs that function on every element and return whether `true` if every evaluation passed or `false` if at least one failed.

```typescript
function isGreaterThanTwo(num) {
	return num > 2
}

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const test1 = nums.every(isGreaterThanTwo)

console.log(test1) // Outputs: false

const nums2 = [3, 4, 5]
const test2 = nums2.every(isGreaterThanTwo)

console.log(test2) // Outputs: true
```

### Array.some

`Array.some` will evaluate a function on every element and return `true` if at least a single evaluation passed otherwise `false` if all failed.

```typescript
function hasGreaterThanTwo(num) {
	return num > 2
}

const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
const test1 = nums.some(hasGreaterThanTwo)

console.log(test1) // Outputs: true

const nums2 = [3, 4, 5]
const test2 = nums2.some(hasGreaterThanTwo)

console.log(test2) // Outputs: true
```

### Array.splice

The `Array.splice` method will either insert, replace, or delete an element depending on the parameters. It helps to understand the parameters of the method: `Array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)`. `start` is the index of where to perform the operation on. The `deleteCount` can be 0 if you prefer not to delete the element at the start position. `item1` and further will be the new value that will replace the values in the array starting at the `start` index. Using splice will affect the current array, so after inserting a value, the indices will change.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

nums.splice(2, 0, 10) // At index 2, insert 10
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 10, 3, 4, 5]

nums.splice(3, 1) // Delete the element at index 3
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 10, 4, 5]

nums.splice(2, 1, 3) // At index 2, replace the element with 3
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

nums.splice(5, 0, 6, 7, 8, 9) // At index 5, insert the values 6, 7, 8, 9
console.log(nums) // Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Array.slice

`Array.slice` returns a shallow copy of the array with the given start and end indices. It will copy up to but not including the end index.

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const arr = nums.slice(1, 3) // Start copying the array from index 1 and up to 3 (but not including)
console.log(arr) // Outputs: [2, 3]
```

## Summary

Arrays in JavaScript are fundamental data structures that are incredibly versatile and integral to almost any web-based application. Featuring a wide array of built-in methods, JavaScript arrays enable efficient data manipulation, from addition and deletion of elements to mapping, filtering, and reduction of data. The use of arrays for properly organizing and processing data greatly increases the readability and maintainability of your code. Additionally, with concepts like [destructuring](/destructuring-in-javascript), JavaScript arrays can be utilized effectively to unpack elements for easy assignment to variables. Undoubtedly, understanding and skillfully handling arrays is a fundamental competency in JavaScript programming.
