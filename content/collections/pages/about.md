I am a web developer with decades of experience. My main expertise is JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP. I enjoy learning programming and exploring the latest trends in the JS and PHP world. This website is an area for me to collect and share my thoughts. It will mainly focus on programming and the technologies that I use (visit the [Topics page](/topics) to see).

While I'm not programming, I enjoy traveling and watching films with my life. Check out my [Letterboxed](https://letterboxd.com/Vinh_P/) page.
